# HealthCheckerNode

## Install

<pre>
  In future: (not implement yet)
  git clone git://github.com/aoqfonseca/healthCheckerNode.git
  cd healthCheckerNode
  node checker
</pre>


## Super simple to use

First this is come from other app maked in Sinatra/Ruby. The propose is create a simples webapp to check health link from another webapps and showing in the pretty funny way.


#### First steps

For the moment there's nothing implemented. I'm just look around NodeJS and some modules to do this. All suggest will be welcome.

The goals are:

* `very simple to use and configure` - I want to do something simples and very quickly to start. 
* `Rich and Funny interface` - There's a lot of other tools for this, but none of them is pretty or funny. I really want create an interface that you like see every time



**Notice**

I not implement yet. This for my studies about NodeJS.
